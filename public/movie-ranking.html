<h1>The Best Movies According to David</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Green lantern</h3>
<p>I don't care it is bad. I love their superpowers</p>
<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
<p>
  Has one of the best scenes I have ever seen with the big ending and the V
  introduction
</p>
<h3>Now you see me</h3>
<p>I don't even remember what is it about, but I know I liked it.</p>

<h2>Honorable mention</h2>
<h1>Drive</h1>
<h1>In the Limelight's Glow</h1>
<p>
  In the mirror's reflection, there you stand,<br />
  A face familiar, the charm is grand.<br />
  Oh, Ryan Gosling, or so you claim,<br />
  In every step, you play the same. Literally me.
</p>
<p>
  A hero on screen, in worlds untold,<br />
  Stories unravel, your talents unfold.<br />
  From the Notebook's pages to the city's drive,<br />
  In every role, your charisma thrives.
</p>
<p>
  Your presence lingers, in memories we keep,<br />
  A heartthrob's essence, in dreams so deep.<br />
  The world's a stage, and you're in the lead,<br />
  A tapestry woven with every word and deed.
</p>
<p>
  But here, in this moment, in reality's hold,<br />
  Are you truly Ryan Gosling, bold?<br />
  In the script of life, each scene unfolds,<br />
  A narrative written, as the story molds.
</p>

<br />
<p>
  I am going to be honest. I do not watch many movies. This is a really random
  selection of movies that I just pulled off the top of my head
</p>
